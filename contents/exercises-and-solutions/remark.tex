\chapter{Solutions}

As you work through the exercises provided in the previous chapter, you may notice the absence of solutions. Allow me to explain this deliberate choice. In mathematics, true understanding is not achieved by passively reading over material nor by copying solutions someone else has written up but by actively grappling with problems on one's own. The exercises in the previous chapter allow you to do just that. Should you encounter difficulties, I encourage you to persist. Struggle is an inevitable part of the learning process and often leads to profound insights. In case you have dedicated considerable effort to a given problem\footnote{i.e., work on it for an extended period of time, ideally put the problem aside for a couple of days and then come back to it}, and still do not seem to make any progress, feel free to reach out to me via \href{mailto:mrvnthss@mail.de}{mrvnthss@mail.de} and I will be happy to assist.
