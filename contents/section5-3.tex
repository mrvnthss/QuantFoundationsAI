\section{Covering Numbers}

As pointed out in the previous section, we need a suitable generalization of VC theory to find a bound on the Rademacher complexity $\mathcal{R}_n(l \circ \mathcal{F})$ for arbitrary (i.e., possibly infinite) function classes $\mathcal{F}$. We have seen that, as in the case of binary classification, the cardinality of the set $T_l(z) = \set{(l(y_1, f(x_1)), \dots, l(y_n, f(x_n)) \with f \in \mathcal{F}}$ plays a significant role in bounding the Rademacher complexity of $l \circ \mathcal{F}$. When $\mathcal{F}$ is infinite, the set $T_l(z)$ will  most likely be infinite as well. Thus, we need to find a way that lets us treat points in this set that are close to each other as if they were identical. We start with the definition of \emph{covering numbers} of a class $\mathcal{F}$.

\begin{definition}
Let $d$ be a pseudometric\footnote{The only difference between a metric and a pseudometric is the relaxation of the property of \emph{positivity}. A metric requires every pair of distinct points $x$ and $y$ to have a positive distance $d(x, y)$ from each other. In other words, $d(x, y) = 0$ always implies $x = y$ when $d$ is a metric. For a pseudometric, this need not be true, i.e., there can be points $x \neq y$ such that $d(x, y) = 0$.} of a function class $\mathcal{F}$ and let $\varepsilon > 0$. An \emph{$\varepsilon$-net} on $(\mathcal{F}, d)$ is a set of functions $V \subset \mathcal{F}$ such that every function $f \in \mathcal{F}$ is within distance of at most $\varepsilon$ to some function $g \in V$. In other words, for every $f \in \mathcal{F}$ there exists $g \in V$ such that $d(f, g) \leq \varepsilon$.

The \emph{$\varepsilon$-covering number} $N(\mathcal{F}, d, \varepsilon)$ of $(\mathcal{F}, d)$ is the minimum number of functions needed to form an $\varepsilon$-net of $(\mathcal{F}, d)$, i.e.,
\[
    N(\mathcal{F}, d, \varepsilon) = \inf\set{\card{V} \with V \text{ is an } \varepsilon \text{-net of } (\mathcal{F}, d)}.
\]
\end{definition}
